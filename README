# 3mail
A **decentralised** and open-source mailing client. By decentralising the data we get an increased risk
if our private key's are exposed - which is a problem no matter what - but at leveraging the upkeep that
blockchian networks have we have a 24/7 mailing client at a cost of network processing.

Can be enhanced on different networks with encrpyted transactions.
