# 3mail

**A decentralized and open-source mailing client.**

3mail is a fully **decentralized email client** that leverages blockchain networks to provide a **24/7 mailing service** without relying on centralized servers. By decentralizing the data, users retain full control over their mail, but it also means that **exposing your private keys can compromise security**, so always handle keys with care.

## Features

* **Decentralized**: No central server; mail is stored and transmitted through blockchain networks.
* **Open-source**: Fully transparent and customizable.
* **Encrypted**: All messages are encrypted with your private keys.
* **Cross-network compatible**: Can be enhanced on different networks using encrypted transactions.
* **Always-on**: Leveraging blockchain network uptime for continuous availability.

## Why 3mail?

Traditional email systems rely on centralized servers, which can be **targets for hacks or outages**. 3mail decentralizes communication, providing **resilience, transparency, and control** to its users.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** As with any decentralized system, losing your private key or exposing it can compromise your mailbox. Always store your keys securely.

If you want, I can also **make a shorter, “landing page style” version** that looks professional and readable in GitHub’s markdown preview, highlighting the benefits and security considerations right away.

Do you want me to do that?

## Todo
  - To implemenet CLI tools.
  - To implemenet desktop app for windows/mac/unix and phone apps for macOS/Android
  - The web version is really for quick in/out otherwise dong anything else would compromise security, implement local storage
